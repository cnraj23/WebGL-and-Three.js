# WebGL-and-Three.js

In this folder I am adding all the files related to Three.js and WebGL
All these files will include basic understanding of the same.
To run these html files successfully include the 'js' folder in the same path or alocate the path in the html file(s) in place of <script src="js/three.js"> <== this.

Initial files which I am adding are similar to my lessons learnt in the Udemy couse of WebGL and Three.js
It is more like my demosnstration of my skills in webGL and this is how I learnt this.
